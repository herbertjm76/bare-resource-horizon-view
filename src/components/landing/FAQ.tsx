      question: "How is it different from Float?",
      answer: "BareResource is built specifically for design studios. While Float focuses on general project management, we focus on capacity planning with fee burn tracking and real-time utilization alerts that design teams actually need."
    },
    {
      question: "Does it replace our PM tool?",
      answer: "No, BareResource works alongside your existing PM tools. We focus purely on resource planning and capacity management. Keep using your favorite project management tool for tasks and workflows."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after the trial?",
      answer: "After your 14-day trial, choose a plan that fits your team size. No setup fees, cancel anytime. Your data stays yours and you can export it if you ever decide to leave."
