# MVP Presentation Outline - Resource Management SaaS
## AI-Powered Predictive Capacity Planning for Creative Agencies

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Creative Agencies Discover Capacity Crises Too Late

**The Core Issue:**
- Excel shows you *what happened*, not *what will happen*
- 165% utilization discovered after the damage is done
- By the time you see the problem, you've already:
  - Over-committed to clients
  - Burned out your team
  - Lost revenue opportunities

**Quote:** *"We're always firefighting, never preventing"*

---

## 2. The Cost of Reactive Planning

### Quantified Impact:

- **624 overcapacity hours/month** = S$62K revenue leakage (one 25-person team)
- **Average 2-3 week delay** before capacity issues surface
- **40% of projects** start understaffed (industry data)
- **Team burnout:** 165% utilization is unsustainable
- **Lost deals:** Can't confidently scope new projects

### The Core Problem:
Current tools are *dashboards*, not *decision engines*

---

## 3. Solution: Predictive Resource Intelligence

### Positioning:
**"The only resource planning tool that tells you what will happen, not what already happened"**

### Three AI-Powered Capabilities:

1. **Predictive Capacity Alerts**
   - "You'll hit 140% by March 15 - pause new projects or hire"
   - 2-3 week advance warning
   - Actionable recommendations

2. **Herbie AI Assistant**
   - Natural language: "Who's available next week for React work?"
   - Conversational project scoping
   - Instant capacity checks in <3 seconds

3. **Smart Resource Matching** (Coming Q3)
   - AI-matched team composition based on skills, success rate, availability
   - Optimal project staffing recommendations

### Tagline:
**"Prevent capacity crises before they happen"**

---

## 4. Product Demo

### Slide A: The AI Difference

**Competitor (Float/Forecast):**
- Dashboard showing current 165% utilization
- Caption: "Your team is overbooked. Good luck."

**Your Product:**
- Alert: "Predictive capacity warning: You'll reach 140% utilization in 14 days"
- Suggested actions: "Delay Project X by 1 week OR Hire 1 designer"
- Caption: "Two weeks to fix it before it becomes a crisis"

---

### Slide B: Herbie AI in Action

**Example Conversation:**

```
User: "Can we take on a new 80-hour web project next month?"

Herbie: "Not safely. Your team will be at 95% capacity in March, 
and you have Sarah's leave planned. I'd recommend:
- Starting April 3rd instead (team at 65% then)
- OR bringing in a contractor for 2 weeks"
```

**Another Example:**

```
User: "Who can I staff on this React project?"

Herbie: "Based on availability and skills:
- Sarah: 20h available, 95% delivery rate, expert in React
- Tom: 15h available, new to React but learning fast
- Alternative: Bring in contractor Jane (external)"
```

---

### Slide C: Weekly Overview Dashboard

**Key Features:**
- Color-coded allocation grid
- AI-powered capacity predictions overlay
- Smart alerts panel
- Real-time utilization tracking
- Leave management integration

---

### Slide D: Before/After

**Before (Excel):**
- 5 hours/week manual planning
- Discovering problems late
- Reactive firefighting
- Guesswork on capacity

**After (AI-Powered):**
- 5 minutes/day quick checks
- Preventing problems early
- Proactive planning
- Data-driven decisions

---

## 5. Target Customer

2. ‚úÖ "Confidently say yes to new projects"
3. ‚úÖ "Prevent team burnout before it happens"
4. ‚úÖ "Make hiring decisions with data, not gut feel"

### Pain Points:

## Presentation Tips

### Opening Hook (30 seconds):

### Demo First:
Lead with your dashboard showing the 165% utilization warning and Herbie AI predicting the issue 2 weeks early. Make it visceral and real.

### End with Traction:
*"We've tracked 624 overcapacity hours in one month. That's S$62K in saved revenue leakage for one 25-person team. Now imagine 500 agencies across APAC using predictive AI to prevent capacity crises before they happen."*

## Questions to Anticipate

### Q: Why can't competitors just add AI?
**A:** 
1. They're built on legacy architectures - expensive to retrofit
2. We have the data advantage - more customers = smarter predictions
3. Our pricing model (flat fee) enables AI features that per-user models can't afford
4. Agency-specific training data is our moat

### Q: What if OpenAI or similar builds this?
**A:**
1. We're domain-specific (creative agencies) - they're horizontal
2. We own the workflow integration - AI is the brain, not the product
3. We're building on their infrastructure (Lovable AI) - partnership, not competition
4. Our data moat is in agency allocation patterns, not AI models

### Q: How do you prevent churn once they have their processes set up?
**A:**
1. AI gets smarter over time - switching cost increases
2. Historical data locked in our platform
3. Team learns to rely on predictive alerts
4. Continuous feature development (roadmap)

### Q: What's your defensibility against Float or Forecast adding AI?
**A:**
1. Price-performance gap (they charge 3-4x more)
2. Our architecture is AI-native, theirs is retrofitted
3. We're APAC-focused with local support
4. 12-18 month head start in AI training

### Q: How accurate are the predictions?
**A:**
1. Start with 70% accuracy (better than gut feel)
2. Improve to 85%+ with more data (6-12 months)
3. Directional accuracy more important than precision
4. Humans in the loop for final decisions
